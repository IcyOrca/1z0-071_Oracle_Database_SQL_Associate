In Oracle SQL, views are virtual tables based on the result of a SELECT query. 
They provide a way to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic, and grant different levels of access to users. 
Here are some aspects of managing views in Oracle SQL:

1. Creating Views:
You can create a view using the CREATE VIEW statement followed by a SELECT query.
    CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
        SELECT employee_id
             , employee_name
             , department_id
          FROM employees
         WHERE department_id = 10;

2. Altering Views:
To modify an existing view, you can use the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_view AS
        SELECT employee_id
             , employee_name
             , department_id
          FROM employees
         WHERE department_id = 20;

3. Dropping Views:
To remove a view, you can use the DROP VIEW statement.
    DROP VIEW employee_view;

4. Querying Views:
Once a view is created, you can query it like a table.
    SELECT * FROM employee_view;

5. Updating Views:
In some cases, you can update the underlying tables through a view. However, there are certain restrictions, and the view must meet certain criteria.
    UPDATE employee_view
       SET department_id = 30
     WHERE employee_id = 101;

6. Managing View Security:
You can control access to views by granting or revoking privileges.
    Grant SELECT privilege on the view to a user
    GRANT SELECT ON employee_view TO hr_user;

    Revoke SELECT privilege on the view from a user
    REVOKE SELECT ON employee_view FROM hr_user;

7. View Dependencies:
You can query the ALL_DEPENDENCIES data dictionary view to find dependencies of a view.
    SELECT *
      FROM ALL_DEPENDENCIES
     WHERE REFERENCED_NAME = 'EMPLOYEE_VIEW';

8. Materialized Views:
Oracle supports materialized views, which are physical copies of the result set stored in a table. 
They can improve query performance but may require maintenance.
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee AS
        SELECT employee_id
             , employee_name
             , department_id
          FROM employees
         WHERE department_id = 10;

9. Refreshing Materialized Views:
Materialized views need to be refreshed to update the data. You can use the DBMS_MVIEW package or DBMS_SCHEDULER for automatic refresh.
    Manual refresh
    EXEC DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('MV_EMPLOYEE');

    Automatic refresh using DBMS_SCHEDULER
    DBMS_SCHEDULER.create_refresh_job('MV_EMPLOYEE_REFRESH_JOB', INTERVAL=>'SYSDATE + 1');

These are fundamental aspects of managing views in Oracle SQL. 
Views provide a flexible way to organize and present data, and their usage depends on the specific requirements of your database application. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on managing views and materialized views.
