Performing multi-table inserts in Oracle SQL involves inserting data into multiple tables using a single INSERT statement. 
This can be achieved using the INSERT ALL statement with multiple INSERT INTO clauses. Here's an example:

Example: Multi-Table Insert
Suppose you have two tables, "employees" and "departments," and you want to insert data into both tables in a single transaction:
    INSERT ALL 
       INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, salary)
          VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 101, 50000)
       INTO departments (department_id, department_name, location)
          VALUES (101, 'Development', 'New York')
    SELECT * FROM dual;

In this example:
    The INSERT ALL statement allows you to perform multiple INSERT INTO clauses in a single statement.
    The first INSERT INTO clause inserts data into the "employees" table.
    The second INSERT INTO clause inserts data into the "departments" table.
    The SELECT * FROM dual is used to complete the INSERT ALL syntax.

You can customize the data being inserted based on your requirements. Ensure that the columns and values align correctly with the structure of your tables.

It's important to note that this method is useful when you need to maintain consistency between data inserted into multiple tables within a single transaction. 
If an error occurs during the insert operation for any table, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring data integrity.

Always test your multi-table inserts in a safe environment before using them in a production setting, and make sure the column data types and values match the requirements of your tables.
