In a database management system (DBMS), controlling user access involves granting and managing privileges. 
There are two main types of privileges: system privileges and object privileges.

System Privileges:
System privileges are permissions that allow a user to perform certain actions at the system level, such as managing database objects or administering the database itself. 
Here are some common system privileges:
    CREATE SESSION:
        Allows a user to connect to the database.
    CREATE TABLE:
        Allows a user to create new tables in a database.
    CREATE USER:
        Grants the ability to create new user accounts.
    ALTER SYSTEM:
        Provides the ability to alter database-wide settings.
    DROP ANY TABLE:
        Allows a user to drop any table in the database.
    DBA Role:
        Users with the DBA (Database Administrator) role have a wide range of system privileges allowing them to perform administrative tasks.

Object Privileges:
Object privileges, on the other hand, are permissions that apply to specific database objects, such as tables, views, procedures, or sequences. 
Here are some common object privileges:
    SELECT:
        Allows a user to retrieve data from a table or view.
    INSERT:
        Grants the ability to insert new rows into a table.
    UPDATE:
        Allows a user to modify existing rows in a table.
    DELETE:
        Grants the ability to remove rows from a table.
    EXECUTE:
        Provides the ability to execute a stored procedure or function.
    ALTER:
        Allows a user to modify the structure of a table, such as adding or dropping columns.
    REFERENCES:
        Grants the ability to create a foreign key reference to a column.

Granting and Revoking Privileges:
    Granting System Privileges:
    GRANT CREATE SESSION TO username;

    Revoking System Privileges:
    REVOKE CREATE SESSION FROM username;

    Granting Object Privileges:
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO username;

    Revoking Object Privileges:
    REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees FROM username;

Roles:
Roles are a way to group privileges together, simplifying the process of managing and assigning permissions. 
For example, you can create a role with specific system or object privileges and then grant that role to users.
    Creating a Role:
    CREATE ROLE manager_role;

    Granting Privileges to a Role:
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO manager_role;

    Granting a Role to a User:
    GRANT manager_role TO username;

Auditing Access:
Database administrators can use auditing features to track user access, changes, and other activities in the database. 
This helps in monitoring and ensuring security.
    Enabling Auditing:
    AUDIT SELECT TABLE, UPDATE TABLE BY scott BY ACCESS;

    Viewing Audit Information:
    SELECT * FROM DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL WHERE USERNAME = 'SCOTT';

By understanding and appropriately managing system and object privileges, along with utilizing roles and auditing, administrators can control user access to a database system effectively.
