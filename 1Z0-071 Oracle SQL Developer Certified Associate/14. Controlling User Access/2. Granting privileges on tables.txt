Granting privileges on tables in a relational database is a fundamental aspect of controlling user access. 
Here are some common SQL statements for granting privileges on tables:

Object Privileges on Tables:
Granting SELECT Privilege:
Allows a user to retrieve data from a table.

    GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO username;

Granting INSERT Privilege:
Allows a user to insert new rows into a table.
    GRANT INSERT ON table_name TO username;

Granting UPDATE Privilege:
Allows a user to modify existing rows in a table.
    GRANT UPDATE ON table_name TO username;

Granting DELETE Privilege:
Allows a user to remove rows from a table.
    GRANT DELETE ON table_name TO username;

Granting ALL Privileges:
Grants all available privileges on a table.
    GRANT ALL ON table_name TO username;

Granting Privileges with the OPTION Clause:
When granting privileges, you can use the WITH OPTION clause to allow the grantee to further grant those privileges to other users. For example:
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO username WITH GRANT OPTION;

Granting Privileges to Roles:
Instead of granting privileges directly to individual users, you can grant privileges to roles and then assign those roles to users.
    Creating a Role:
    CREATE ROLE role_name;

    Granting Privileges to a Role:
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO role_name;

    Granting the Role to a User:
    GRANT role_name TO username;

Revoking Privileges:
To revoke previously granted privileges, you can use the REVOKE statement.
    Revoking SELECT Privilege:
    REVOKE SELECT ON table_name FROM username;

    Revoking ALL Privileges:
    REVOKE ALL ON table_name FROM username;

Viewing Granted Privileges:
To view the privileges granted on a table, you can query the USER_TAB_PRIVS or ALL_TAB_PRIVS view.
    SELECT * FROM USER_TAB_PRIVS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'table_name';


Remember to replace username and table_name with the appropriate values based on your database schema and user accounts. 
Always grant the minimum necessary privileges to users to ensure the principle of least privilege and enhance security.
