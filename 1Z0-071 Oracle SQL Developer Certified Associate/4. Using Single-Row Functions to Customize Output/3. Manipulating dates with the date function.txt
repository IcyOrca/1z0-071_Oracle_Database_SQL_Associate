In Oracle SQL, the DATE data type and various date functions are used to manipulate date values. 
Here are some common date functions and examples of how to use them:

1. CURRENT_DATE:
Returns the current date.
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date
      FROM dual;

2. SYSDATE:
Returns the current date and time.
    SELECT SYSDATE AS current_datetime
      FROM dual;

3. LAST_DAY:
Returns the last day of the month for a given date.
    SELECT LAST_DAY(SYSDATE) AS last_day_of_month
      FROM dual;

4. NEXT_DAY:
Returns the last day of the month for a given date.
    SELECT NEXT_DAY(SYSDATE) AS last_day_of_month
      FROM dual;

5. TO_DATE and TO_CHAR:
TO_DATE converts a string to a date, and TO_CHAR converts a date to a string.
    SELECT TO_DATE('20/11/2023', 'DD/MM/RRRR') AS converted_date
      FROM dual;

    SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DD/MM/RRRR HH24:MI:SS') AS formatted_date
      FROM dual;

These examples demonstrate how to use various date functions in Oracle SQL to manipulate and work with date values. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on these functions and their parameters.
