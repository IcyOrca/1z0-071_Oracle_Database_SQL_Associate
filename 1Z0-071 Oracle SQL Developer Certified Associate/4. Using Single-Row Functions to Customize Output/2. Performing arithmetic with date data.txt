Performing arithmetic with date data in Oracle SQL involves using various date functions and arithmetic operators. 
Here are some common scenarios and examples:

1. Adding/Subtracting Days:
Use the + and - operators to add or subtract days from a date.
    Adding 5 days to the current date:
    SELECT SYSDATE + 5 AS future_date
      FROM dual;

    Subtracting 10 days from a specific date:
    SELECT hire_date - 10 AS past_date
      FROM employees
     WHERE employee_id = 101;

2. Calculating Date Differences:
Use the - operator to find the difference between two dates.
    Calculating the number of days between two dates:
    SELECT end_date - start_date AS days_difference
      FROM some_table;

3. Adding/Subtracting Months:
Use the ADD_MONTHS function to add or subtract months from a date.
    Adding 3 months to a specific date:
    SELECT ADD_MONTHS(some_date, 3) AS future_date
      FROM some_table;

    Subtracting 2 months from the current date:
    SELECT ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -2) AS past_date
      FROM dual;

4. Calculating Age:
Use the MONTHS_BETWEEN function to calculate the number of months between two dates.
    Calculating age in years:
    SELECT employee_name, TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, birth_date) / 12) AS age
      FROM employees;

5. Extracting Components:
Use the EXTRACT function to retrieve specific components (year, month, day) from a date.
    Extracting the year from a date:
    SELECT employee_name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS hire_year
      FROM employees;

6. Interval Arithmetic:
Use the INTERVAL keyword for more complex date arithmetic.
    Adding 3 months and 10 days to a date:
    SELECT some_date + INTERVAL '3' MONTH + INTERVAL '10' DAY AS future_date
      FROM some_table;

These examples showcase the flexibility of Oracle SQL when working with date arithmetic. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for comprehensive information on date functions and their usage.
