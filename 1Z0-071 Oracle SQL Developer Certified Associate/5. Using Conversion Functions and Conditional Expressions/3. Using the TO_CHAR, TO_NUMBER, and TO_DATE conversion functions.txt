In Oracle SQL, the TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER, and TO_DATE conversion functions are used to explicitly convert values from one data type to another. 
Here are examples of how each function can be used:

1. TO_CHAR:
The TO_CHAR function converts a value to a character string.
    SELECT TO_CHAR(salary, '$999,999.99') AS formatted_salary
      FROM employees;

2. TO_NUMBER:
The TO_NUMBER function converts a character string to a number.
    SELECT employee_id, TO_NUMBER('12345') AS numeric_employee_id
      FROM employees;

3. TO_DATE:
The TO_DATE function converts a character string to a date.
    SELECT hire_date, TO_DATE('2022-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS converted_date
      FROM employees;

These conversion functions provide flexibility when working with different data types in Oracle SQL. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on these functions and their parameters.
