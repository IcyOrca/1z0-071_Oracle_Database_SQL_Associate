In Oracle SQL, the NVL, NULLIF, and COALESCE functions are commonly used to handle NULL values in data. 
Here are examples of how to use each function:

1. NVL Function:
The NVL function is used to replace a NULL value with a specified default value.
    SELECT employee_id
         , NVL(salary, 0) AS actual_salary
      FROM employees;

2. NULLIF Function:
The NULLIF function returns NULL if two expressions are equal; otherwise, it returns the first expression.
    SELECT employee_id, NULLIF(commission_pct, 0) AS commission_percentage
      FROM employees;

3. COALESCE Function:
The COALESCE function returns the first non-NULL expression in the list.
    SELECT employee_id, COALESCE(manager_id, supervisor_id, 'Not Assigned') AS assigned_manager
      FROM employees;

4. Using NVL2 for Conditional Replacement:
The NVL2 function is used for conditional replacement. It returns the first expression if it is not NULL; otherwise, it returns the second expression.
    SELECT employee_id, NVL2(manager_id, 'Assigned', 'Not Assigned') AS manager_assignment
      FROM employees;

These functions provide flexibility in dealing with NULL values in SQL queries. 
Choose the function that best fits the logic you need for handling NULLs in your specific use case. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you're using for detailed information on these functions and their parameters.
