In Oracle SQL, set operators (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS) allow you to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements. 
To use set operators, the SELECT statements involved must have compatible columns in terms of number and data types. 
Here are examples of using INTERSECT:

1. INTERSECT Operator:
The INTERSECT operator returns the common rows between two SELECT statements.

SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;

These examples demonstrate how to use the INTERSECT clause with set operators in Oracle SQL. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on using set operators and the INTERSECT clause together.
