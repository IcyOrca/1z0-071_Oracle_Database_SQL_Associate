In Oracle SQL, the UNION and UNION ALL operators are used to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements. 
Here are some examples of using these operators:

1. UNION Operator:
The UNION operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements, and it removes duplicate rows from the result set.
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;

2. UNION ALL Operator:
The UNION ALL operator is similar to UNION, but it does not remove duplicate rows; it includes all rows from the combined result sets.
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;


These examples demonstrate how to use the UNION and UNION ALL operators in Oracle SQL to combine and compare the results of multiple SELECT statements. 
Always ensure that the involved SELECT statements have compatible columns, and use UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable or desirable. 
Refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for comprehensive information on set operators and their usage.
