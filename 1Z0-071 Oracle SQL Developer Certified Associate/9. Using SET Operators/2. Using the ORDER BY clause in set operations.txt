When using set operators within a subquery and wanting to apply the ORDER BY clause to the subquery
, you can use the ORDER BY clause at the end of each SELECT statement within the parentheses. 
Here is an example:

    SELECT *
      FROM (SELECT employee_id
                 , employee_name 
              FROM employees
            UNION
            SELECT manager_id
                 , manager_name 
              FROM managers
            ORDER BY 1)
     WHERE department_id = 10;

These examples demonstrate how to use the ORDER BY clause with set operators in Oracle SQL. 
The ORDER BY clause is applied to the final result set after the set operation has been performed. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on using set operators and the ORDER BY clause together.
