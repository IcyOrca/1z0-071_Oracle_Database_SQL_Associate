In Oracle SQL, the ROUND, TRUNC, and MOD functions are commonly used to manipulate numbers. 
Here are examples of how each function can be used:

1. ROUND Function:
The ROUND function is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.
    Rounding a number to two decimal places:
    SELECT ROUND(15.6789, 2) AS rounded_number
      FROM dual;

2. TRUNC Function:
The TRUNC function is used to truncate a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places or truncate a date to a specified date component.
    Truncating a number to one decimal place:
    SELECT TRUNC(25.345, 1) AS truncated_number
      FROM dual;

3. MOD Function:
The MOD function returns the remainder of a division operation.
    Calculating the remainder of the division:
    SELECT MOD(17, 5) AS remainder
      FROM dual;

    Using MOD to check for even numbers:
    SELECT employee_id
      FROM employees
     WHERE MOD(employee_id, 2) = 0;

These examples illustrate how to use the ROUND, TRUNC, and MOD functions to manipulate numbers in various ways. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on these functions and their parameters.
