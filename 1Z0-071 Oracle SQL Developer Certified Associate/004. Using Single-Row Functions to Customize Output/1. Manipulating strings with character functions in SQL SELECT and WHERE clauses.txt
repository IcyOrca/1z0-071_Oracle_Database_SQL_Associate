In SQL, character functions are used to manipulate and perform operations on string data. 
These functions can be used in both the SELECT and WHERE clauses to manipulate string values. 
Here are some commonly used character functions in SQL:

1. LENGTH:
Returns the length (number of characters) of a string.
     Using LENGTH
    SELECT first_name
         , LENGTH(first_name) AS name_length
      FROM employees;

2. SUBSTR:
Extracts a substring from a string.
    SELECT product_name
         , SUBSTR(product_name, 1, 5) AS short_name
      FROM products;

3. UPPER and LOWER:
Converts a string to uppercase or lowercase.
    SELECT first_name
         , UPPER(first_name) AS upper_name
         , LOWER(last_name) AS lower_last_name
      FROM employees;

4. TRIM:
Removes leading or trailing spaces from a string.
    SELECT product_name
        , TRIM(BOTH ' ' FROM product_name) AS trimmed_name
      FROM products;

5. REPLACE:
Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.
    SELECT product_name
         , REPLACE(product_name, 'Small', 'Large') AS updated_name
      FROM products;

6. INSTR:
Finds the position of a substring within a string.
    SELECT product_name, INSTR(product_name, 'XL') AS position_in_string
      FROM products;

7. LEFT and RIGHT are not directly available in Oracle SQL. Instead, you can use SUBSTR:
Extracts a specified number of characters from the left or right of a string.
    SELECT product_name
         , SUBSTR(product_name, 1, 3) AS left_part
      FROM products;

8. CASE-SENSITIVE COMPARISON:
For case-sensitive comparison, you can use the BINARY operator.
    SELECT first_name
      FROM employees
     WHERE first_name = BINARY 'John';

These examples should be applicable in an Oracle SQL environment. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the most accurate and detailed information related to your specific version of Oracle SQL.
