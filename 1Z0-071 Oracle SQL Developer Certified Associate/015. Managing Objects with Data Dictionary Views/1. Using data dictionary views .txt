In Oracle SQL, the data dictionary views provide information about the database objects, user accounts, privileges, and other metadata. 
These views are part of the data dictionary, a set of tables and views containing metadata about the database. 
Here are some commonly used data dictionary views and examples of how to use them:

1. ALL_TABLES:
Provides information about tables accessible by the current user.
    SELECT table_name
         , num_rows
      FROM all_tables
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

2. ALL_TAB_COLUMNS:
Contains information about columns of tables accessible by the current user.
    SELECT table_name
         , column_name
         , data_type
      FROM all_tab_columns
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

3. ALL_VIEWS:
Provides information about views accessible by the current user.
    SELECT view_name
         , text
      FROM all_views
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

4. USER_OBJECTS:
Contains information about objects owned by the current user.
    SELECT object_name
         , object_type
      FROM user_objects;

5. ALL_USERS:
Contains information about all database users.
    SELECT username
         , account_status
      FROM all_users;

6. DBA_TABLES:
Provides information about all tables in the database (requires DBA privileges).
    SELECT table_name
         , num_rows
      FROM dba_tables
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

7. DBA_TAB_COLUMNS:
Contains information about columns of all tables in the database (requires DBA privileges).
    SELECT table_name
         , column_name
         , data_type
      FROM dba_tab_columns
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

8. DBA_VIEWS:
    SELECT view_name
         , text
      FROM dba_views
     WHERE owner = 'HR';

9. DBA_USERS:
Contains information about all database users (requires DBA privileges).
    SELECT username
         , account_status
      FROM dba_users;


These examples demonstrate how to use data dictionary views to obtain information about database objects, users, and other metadata. 
Always ensure that you have the necessary privileges to access specific views, especially those prefixed with "DBA_." Refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for comprehensive information on data dictionary views and their columns.
