Theoretical Aspects:

    Tables/Relations:
        Definition: A relational database is organized into tables or relations. Each table consists of rows and columns.
        Purpose: Tables represent entities (e.g., customers, products) and their attributes.

    Attributes/Fields:
        Definition: Columns in a table that represent the properties or attributes of the entities.
        Purpose: Attributes store specific information about the entities in the table.

    Tuples/Rows:
        Definition: Each row in a table is called a tuple. It represents a specific instance or record of the entity.
        Purpose: Tuples hold the actual data.

    Keys:
        Primary Key: A unique identifier for each tuple in a table. Ensures data integrity.
        Foreign Key: Links one table to the primary key of another table. Establishes relationships.

    Relationships:
        Definition: Connections between tables based on common keys.
        Purpose: Represent associations between different entities.

    Normalization:
        Definition: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
        Purpose: Ensures efficient data storage and minimizes data anomalies.

Physical Aspects:

    Storage Structures:
        Data Pages: The basic unit of data storage.
        Tablespaces: Logical storage containers for data pages.

    Indexes:
        Definition: Data structures that provide fast access to rows based on column values.
        Purpose: Improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

    Caching and Buffering:
        Buffer Pool: In-memory storage for frequently accessed data.
        Cache: Storage for frequently used query results.

    File Organization:
        Data Files: Physical files on disk storing the actual data.
        Log Files: Record changes made to the database for recovery purposes.

    Concurrency Control:
        Locking Mechanisms: Ensure data consistency in multi-user environments.
        Isolation Levels: Define the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other transactions.

    Query Optimization:
        Query Planner: Determines the most efficient way to execute a query.
        Indexes and Statistics: Used to improve query performance.

    Backup and Recovery:
        Backup Strategies: Regularly create copies of the database.
        Recovery Mechanisms: Restore the database to a consistent state after a failure.

    Security:
        Access Control: Define who can access and modify data.
        Encryption: Protect sensitive data during transmission and storage.
