In Oracle SQL, group functions are used to perform operations on sets of rows and return a single result. 
Here are examples of using some common group functions:

1. COUNT Function:
The COUNT function is used to count the number of rows in a set.
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees
      FROM employees;

2. SUM Function:
The SUM function is used to calculate the sum of a numeric column.
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;

This query returns the total salary for each department.
3. AVG Function:
The AVG function calculates the average value of a numeric column.
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;

4. MAX and MIN Functions:
The MAX and MIN functions retrieve the maximum and minimum values, respectively, from a column.
    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary, MIN(salary) AS min_salary
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;

5. GROUP_CONCAT (LISTAGG in Oracle 11g and later):
The LISTAGG function in Oracle concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.
    SELECT department_id
         , LISTAGG(employee_name, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY employee_name) AS employee_list
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;

6. GROUPING SETS:
GROUPING SETS allow you to specify multiple grouping criteria in a single query.
    SELECT department_id
         , job_id
         , COUNT(*) AS employee_count
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((department_id)
                          , (job_id)
                          , ());

7. ROLLUP:
ROLLUP is used to create subtotals and grand totals for a set of columns.
    SELECT department_id
         , job_id
         , COUNT(*) AS employee_count
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY ROLLUP (department_id
                    , job_id);

8. CUBE:
CUBE generates all possible subtotals and grand totals for a set of columns.
    SELECT department_id
         , job_id
         , COUNT(*) AS employee_count
      FROM employees
     GROUP BY CUBE (department_id
                  , job_id);

These examples demonstrate the use of various group functions in Oracle SQL. 
Group functions are powerful tools for summarizing and aggregating data in a relational database. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on group functions and their usage.
