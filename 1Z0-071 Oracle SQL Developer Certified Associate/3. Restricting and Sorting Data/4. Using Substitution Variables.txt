Substitution variables are not a standard feature of SQL, but they are commonly used in some database environments
, such as Oracle SQLPlus. Substitution variables are used to replace placeholders with actual values in a SQL script or command. 
Here is an example of how substitution variables can be used in Oracle SQLPlus:

Example in Oracle SQL*Plus:

Define a substitution variable
    ACCEPT department_id CHAR PROMPT 'Enter Department ID: ';

Use the substitution variable in a SQL query
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
      FROM employees
     WHERE department_id = '&department_id';

In this example:

    ACCEPT: Defines a substitution variable named department_id and prompts the user to enter a value for it.
    &department_id: Uses the substitution variable in the SQL query. When the script runs, SQL*Plus prompts the user for the value of department_id, and the entered value is substituted into the query.

Keep in mind that the usage of variables can vary between different database systems, and substitution variables
, as shown in the Oracle SQL*Plus example, are specific to certain environments. 
Always refer to the documentation of the specific database system you are using for the correct syntax and usage.
