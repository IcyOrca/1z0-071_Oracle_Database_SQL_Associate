Limiting the number of rows returned in a SQL statement is often necessary, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here are some ways to achieve this in SQL:

1. Using the LIMIT Clause:
The LIMIT clause is commonly used to restrict the number of rows returned in the result set. It is supported by databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others.
    SELECT *
      FROM table_name
     LIMIT n;

2. Using the FETCH FIRST Clause (ANSI SQL):
The FETCH FIRST clause is part of the SQL:2008 standard and can be used to limit the number of rows returned.
    SELECT *
      FROM table_name
     FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY;

3. Using ROWNUM or ROW_NUMBER() (Oracle):
In Oracle, you can use ROWNUM or ROW_NUMBER() with a subquery to limit the number of rows returned.
    SELECT column1
         , column2
     FROM (SELECT column1
                , column2
             FROM table_name
            WHERE ROWNUM <= n);

4. Using OFFSET and FETCH (for Pagination):
To implement pagination, you can use OFFSET and FETCH clauses.
    SELECT *
      FROM table_name
    OFFSET m ROWS FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY;

These methods allow you to control the number of rows returned in your SQL queries
, whether you need a fixed number of rows, the first N rows, or a specific range for implementing pagination. 
The exact syntax may vary depending on the database management system you are using.
