Sorting data in SQL is done using the ORDER BY clause in your SELECT statement. 
This clause allows you to sort the result set based on one or more columns. 
The default sorting order is ascending, but you can specify ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order explicitly.

1. Basic Usage:
    SELECT product_name, unit_price, supplier_id
      FROM products
    ORDER BY supplier_id, unit_price DESC;

2. Sorting NULL Values:
    SELECT product_name, unit_price, supplier_id
      FROM products
    ORDER BY supplier_id ASC NULLS FIRST;

Sorting is a crucial aspect of retrieving and presenting data in a meaningful way. 
The ORDER BY clause provides flexibility in specifying the sorting criteria and order for your result set.
