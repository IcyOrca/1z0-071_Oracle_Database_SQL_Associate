In Oracle SQL, a single-row subquery is a query that returns only one row and one column. 
Single-row subqueries can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING clauses, to solve queries.
Here is an example of using a single-row subquery:

Example: Using Single Row Subquery in a SELECT Statement
Suppose you have a "salaries" table, and you want to retrieve employees whose salary is greater than the average salary for their department:
    SELECT employee_id
         , employee_name
         , salary
         , (SELECT AVG(salary) 
              FROM salaries s2 
             WHERE s2.department_id = s1.department_id) AS avg_department_salary
      FROM salaries s1;

In this example:
    The main query retrieves information from the "salaries" table (aliased as s1).
    The subquery (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM salaries s2 WHERE s2.department_id = s1.department_id) calculates the average salary for the department of each employee in the main query.
    The result set includes the employee ID, employee name, salary, and the average salary for the employees department.

You can use single-row subqueries in other contexts as well. 
For instance, you might use a single-row subquery in a WHERE clause to filter records based on a specific condition:
    SELECT employee_id
         , employee_name
         , salary
      FROM employees
     WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

In this example, the main query retrieves employees whose salary is greater than the overall average salary in the "employees" table.

Single-row subqueries are powerful tools for solving queries by providing a dynamic way to incorporate calculated or derived values into your SQL statements. 
Always ensure that your subqueries return only one row and one column when using them in contexts where a single value is expected.
