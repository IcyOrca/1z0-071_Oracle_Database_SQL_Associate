In Oracle SQL, the INTERVAL data type is used to represent a period of time. 
It can be used to perform arithmetic operations on date and timestamp values. 
Here are examples of how to work with INTERVAL data types:

1. Creating INTERVALs:
You can create intervals using the INTERVAL keyword.
    Creating an interval of 3 days
    SELECT SYSDATE + INTERVAL '3' DAY AS future_date
      FROM dual;

    Creating an interval of 2 hours and 30 minutes
    SELECT SYSTIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '2 30' MINUTE TO SECOND AS future_timestamp
      FROM dual;

2. Adding and Subtracting INTERVALs:
You can perform arithmetic operations with intervals.
    Adding 1 month to the current date
    SELECT SYSDATE + INTERVAL '1' MONTH AS future_date
      FROM dual;

    Subtracting 1 hour from the current timestamp
    SELECT SYSTIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1' HOUR AS past_timestamp
      FROM dual;

3. Extracting Components from INTERVALs:
You can use the EXTRACT function to retrieve specific components from an interval.
    Extracting the number of days from an interval
    SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM INTERVAL '5' DAY) AS days_in_interval
      FROM dual;

    Extracting the number of hours from an interval
    SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM INTERVAL '2 03:30:00' DAY TO SECOND) AS hours_in_interval
    FROM dual;

4. Using INTERVAL with TIMESTAMP Data:
You can add an interval to a timestamp to get a new timestamp.
    Adding 3 hours and 30 minutes to the current timestamp
    SELECT SYSTIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '3 30' MINUTE TO SECOND AS future_timestamp
      FROM dual;

5. Using INTERVAL in WHERE Clause:
You can use intervals in the WHERE clause to filter data based on time periods.
    Selecting orders placed in the last 7 days
    SELECT order_id, order_date
      FROM orders
     WHERE order_date > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '7' DAY;

6. Formatting INTERVAL Data:
You can use the TO_DSINTERVAL function to format an interval.
    Formatting an interval
    SELECT TO_DSINTERVAL('0 05:30:00') AS formatted_interval
      FROM dual;

7. Extracting DAY TO SECOND Interval Components:
When working with DAY TO SECOND intervals, you can extract individual components.
    Extracting days and hours from a DAY TO SECOND interval
    SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM INTERVAL '3 12:30:00' DAY TO SECOND) AS days_in_interval,
           EXTRACT(HOUR FROM INTERVAL '3 12:30:00' DAY TO SECOND) AS hours_in_interval
      FROM dual;

These examples illustrate various ways to work with INTERVAL data types in Oracle SQL. 
The INTERVAL data type is powerful for representing and manipulating periods of time in a precise manner. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on INTERVAL data types and their usage.
