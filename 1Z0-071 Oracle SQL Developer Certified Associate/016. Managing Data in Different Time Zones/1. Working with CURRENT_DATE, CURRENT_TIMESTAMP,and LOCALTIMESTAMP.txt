When working with data in different time zones in Oracle SQL, it is important to be mindful of time zone conversions and use appropriate date and timestamp functions. 
Here are examples of how to manage data in different time zones using CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, and LOCALTIMESTAMP:

1. CURRENT_DATE:
The CURRENT_DATE function returns the current date in the session time zone.
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date
      FROM dual;

2. CURRENT_TIMESTAMP:
The CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function returns the current date and time in the session time zone.
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS current_datetime
      FROM dual;

3. LOCALTIMESTAMP:
The LOCALTIMESTAMP function also returns the current date and time, but it returns it in the session time zone.
    SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP AS local_datetime
      FROM dual;

4. Handling Different Time Zones:
To work with data in different time zones, you can use the AT TIME ZONE clause to convert a timestamp to a different time zone.
    SELECT order_id, order_date
      FROM orders
     WHERE order_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC';

5. Converting to a Specific Time Zone:
You can explicitly convert a timestamp to a specific time zone using the FROM_TZ function.
    SELECT order_id, FROM_TZ(order_date, 'America/New_York') AS order_date_ny
      FROM orders;

6. Working with Session Time Zone:
You can change the session time zone using the ALTER SESSION statement.
    ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE = 'UTC';
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS current_datetime_utc
      FROM dual;

7. Extracting Time Zone Information:
You can extract time zone information using the EXTRACT function.
    SELECT order_id, EXTRACT(TIMEZONE_HOUR FROM order_date) AS timezone_offset
      FROM orders;

These examples demonstrate how to work with date and timestamp functions in different time zones in Oracle SQL. 
Always consider the time zone information when handling date and time data to ensure accurate and consistent results. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on these functions and their parameters.
