In SQL, you can drop columns from a table using the ALTER TABLE statement. 
Additionally, Oracle Database provides the ability to mark a column as "UNUSED" without physically removing it from the table. 
Let's look at examples for dropping columns and setting a column as UNUSED in Oracle:

Dropping Columns:
To drop a column from a table, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP COLUMN clause. Here's an example:
    ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN hire_date;

Setting Column UNUSED:
Oracle Database allows you to mark a column as UNUSED without actually dropping it from the table. 
This can be useful if you want to temporarily hide a column without affecting the table structure. 
The syntax is as follows:
    ALTER TABLE employees SET UNUSED COLUMN hire_date;

This marks the "hire_date" column as UNUSED in the "employees" table. The column will be ignored by most SQL operations, and its space will not be reclaimed. 
You can later remove the column from the table permanently using the DROP UNUSED COLUMNS statement:
    ALTER TABLE employees DROP UNUSED COLUMNS;

This statement removes all columns marked as UNUSED from the "employees" table.

Please note that marking a column as UNUSED and later dropping it is specific to Oracle Database. Other database management systems may have different approaches to achieve similar results. 
Always consult the documentation of the database system you are working with for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
