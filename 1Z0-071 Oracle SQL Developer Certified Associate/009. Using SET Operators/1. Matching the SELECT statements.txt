In Oracle SQL, set operators (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS) allow you to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements. 
To use set operators, the SELECT statements involved must have compatible columns in terms of number and data types. 
Here are examples of using set operators to match SELECT statements:

1. UNION Operator:
The UNION operator combines the results of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates.
    -- Example 1: UNION with similar columns
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;

    -- Example 2: UNION with different columns (requires aliasing)
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT department_id AS employee_id, department_name AS employee_name FROM departments;

2. INTERSECT Operator:
The INTERSECT operator returns the common rows between two SELECT statements.
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    INTERSECT
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;

3. MINUS Operator:
The MINUS operator returns the rows from the first SELECT statement that are not present in the second SELECT statement.
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    MINUS
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers;

4. Matching SELECT Statements with Set Operators:
Ensure that the SELECT statements have compatible columns in terms of number and data types.
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees
    UNION
    SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers WHERE hire_date > TO_DATE('2022-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');

5. Applying Set Operators to More Than Two Queries:
You can use parentheses to control the order of evaluation when applying set operators to more than two queries.
    (SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees)
    UNION
    (SELECT manager_id, manager_name FROM managers)
    MINUS
    (SELECT contractor_id, contractor_name FROM contractors);

6. Using Set Operators in the WHERE Clause:
You can use set operators within the WHERE clause for more complex conditions.
    SELECT employee_id
         , employee_name 
      FROM employees 
     WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT manager_id 
                             FROM managers 
                            WHERE hire_date > SYSDATE - 365);

These examples demonstrate how to use set operators to match SELECT statements in Oracle SQL. 
When using set operators, always ensure that the involved SELECT statements have compatible columns. 
Additionally, be mindful of performance considerations, especially with large datasets. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on set operators and their usage.
