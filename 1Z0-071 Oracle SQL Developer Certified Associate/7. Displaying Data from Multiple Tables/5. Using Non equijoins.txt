A non-equijoin, also known as a theta join, is a type of join in SQL where the join condition is based on a comparison other than equality between columns. 
Unlike an equijoin, which uses the equal (=) operator, a non-equijoin uses other comparison operators such as <, >, <=, >=, or <> (not equal).

Here is an example of using a non-equijoin in Oracle SQL:
Example: Non-Equijoin

Lets say you have two tables, "employees" and "salaries," and you want to retrieve employees whose salary is greater than the average salary in the "salaries" table:
    SELECT e.employee_id
         , e.employee_name
         , e.salary
         , s.average_salary
      FROM employees e
      JOIN (SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
              FROM salaries
             GROUP BY department_id) s 
           ON e.department_id = s.department_id 
          AND e.salary > s.average_salary;

In this example:
    The subquery calculates the average salary for each department in the "salaries" table.
    The main query then performs a non-equijoin between the "employees" table and the subquery based on the department_id.
    The join condition includes the additional condition e.salary > s.average_salary, making it a non-equijoin.

This query retrieves employees along with their salaries and the average salary for their respective departments
, but only includes employees whose salary is greater than the departments average salary.

Non-equijoins are useful when you need to compare columns using conditions other than equality. 
However, they should be used carefully, as they might involve more complex logic and potentially result in larger result sets.

Always ensure that your non-equijoins make sense in the context of your data and business requirements. 
Understanding the relationships between columns and the logic behind the join conditions is crucial for writing accurate and efficient queries.
