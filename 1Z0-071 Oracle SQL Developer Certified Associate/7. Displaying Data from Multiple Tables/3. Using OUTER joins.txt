Outer joins in SQL, including Oracle SQL, are used to retrieve records from one table
, even if there are no corresponding matches in another table. 
There are three types of outer joins: LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. Here are examples of each:

1. LEFT OUTER JOIN:
The LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all records from the left table (the table specified before the JOIN keyword) 
and the matched records from the right table. 
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
    SELECT employees.employee_id
         , employees.employee_name
         , departments.department_name
      FROM employees
      LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

2. RIGHT OUTER JOIN:
The RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all records from the right table (the table specified after the JOIN keyword) and the matched records from the left table. 
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
    SELECT employees.employee_id
         , employees.employee_name
         , departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

3. FULL OUTER JOIN:
The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either the left or the right table. 
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
    SELECT employees.employee_id
         , employees.employee_name
         , departments.department_name
      FROM employees
      FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

These examples demonstrate the use of outer joins in Oracle SQL. 
The choice of which type of outer join to use depends on the specific requirements of your query and the relationship between the tables. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on outer joins and their usage.
