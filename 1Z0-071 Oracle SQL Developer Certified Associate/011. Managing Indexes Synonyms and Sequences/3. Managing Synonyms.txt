In Oracle SQL, a synonym is an alias for a database object, such as a table, view, sequence, or another synonym. 
Synonyms provide a way to simplify SQL statements and to mask the underlying structure of the database. 
Here are key operations related to managing synonyms:

Creating a Synonym:
To create a synonym, you can use the CREATE SYNONYM statement. For example:
    CREATE SYNONYM emp_syn FOR employees;

In this example:
    The synonym named emp_syn is created for the employees table.
    Now, you can refer to the employees table using the emp_syn alias.

Dropping a Synonym:
To remove a synonym, you can use the DROP SYNONYM statement:
    DROP SYNONYM emp_syn;

Viewing Synonym Information:
You can query the data dictionary views to obtain information about existing synonyms. For example:
    SELECT synonym_name, table_name
      FROM user_synonyms
     WHERE synonym_name = 'EMP_SYN';

Altering a Synonym:
Synonyms don't have many alterable properties, but you can replace the underlying object that a synonym refers to using the REPLACE keyword:
    CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM emp_syn FOR new_employees_table;

Public Synonyms:
A public synonym is a synonym that is accessible to all database users. 
To create a public synonym, you need the CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM privilege. For example:
    CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM emp_syn FOR employees;

Public synonyms are available to all users in the database.

Private Synonyms:
A private synonym is specific to the schema in which it is created. 
If no schema is specified, the synonym is created in the schema of the current user. 
Most synonyms are private by default.

Synonyms are useful for simplifying queries, especially in scenarios where the underlying object names may change or when you want to provide a user-friendly name for an object. 
Always ensure that synonyms are appropriately named and documented for clarity and maintainability.
