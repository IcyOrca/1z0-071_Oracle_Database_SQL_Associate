Performing insert, update, and delete operations in Oracle SQL involves using the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, respectively. 
Here are examples for each operation:

1. Insert Operation:
Example: Inserting a New Employee
    INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id, salary)
                   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 101, 50000);

In this example:
    The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert a new row into the "employees" table.
    Values for the columns employee_id, employee_name, department_id, and salary are provided.

2. Update Operation:
Example: Updating Employee Salary
    UPDATE employees
       SET salary = 55000
     WHERE employee_id = 1;

In this example:
    The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in the "employees" table.
    The SET clause specifies the column to be updated (salary), and the new value (55000).
    The WHERE clause specifies the condition for which rows to update (in this case, the employee with employee_id = 1).

3. Delete Operation:
Example: Deleting an Employee
    DELETE employees
     WHERE employee_id = 1;

In this example:
    The DELETE FROM statement is used to remove rows from the "employees" table.
    The WHERE clause specifies the condition for which rows to delete (in this case, the employee with employee_id = 1).

Always use caution when performing update and delete operations, especially when not using a WHERE clause, as it can result in unintended consequences. 
Additionally, consider using transactions to ensure data integrity when performing multiple operations.

Make sure to test these operations in a safe environment, and consider taking backups before making significant changes to your data.
