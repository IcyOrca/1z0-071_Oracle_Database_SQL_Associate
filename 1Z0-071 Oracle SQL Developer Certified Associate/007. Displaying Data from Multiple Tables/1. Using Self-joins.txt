A self-join in SQL is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. 
It is particularly useful when you want to combine rows within the same table based on a related column. 
Here is an example of using a self-join in Oracle SQL:

Lets consider a scenario where you have an "employees" table, and each employee has a manager who is also an employee. 
The "manager_id" column in the "employees" table refers to the "employee_id" of the manager.
Example: Self-Join to Retrieve Employees and Their Managers
    SELECT e.employee_id
         , e.employee_name
         , m.employee_name AS manager_name
      FROM employees e
      LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;

In this example:
    The table alias e is used for the employees information.
    The table alias m is used for the managers information.
    The LEFT JOIN is used to include all employees, even those who may not have a manager.
    The join condition is e.manager_id = m.employee_id, which means that we are matching the "manager_id" of employees with the "employee_id" of managers.
    If an employee does not have a manager (e.g., a CEO), the "manager_name" will be NULL.

More Complex Example: Displaying Employee Hierarchy
If you want to display the hierarchy of employees and their managers in a hierarchical structure, you might use a CONNECT BY clause in Oracle. 
Here is an example:
    SELECT employee_id
         , employee_name
         , manager_id
         , LEVEL
      FROM employees
     START WITH manager_id IS NULL
    CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
    ORDER BY LEVEL, employee_id;

In this query:
    The START WITH clause specifies the root of the hierarchy (employees without managers).
    The CONNECT BY clause defines the hierarchical relationship between the "employee_id" and "manager_id."
    The PRIOR keyword refers to the parent row in the hierarchy.
    The LEVEL pseudocolumn indicates the level of the hierarchy.

These examples showcase the use of self-joins in Oracle SQL for scenarios where there is a hierarchical relationship within the same table. 
The specific structure of your database and the relationships between columns will determine how you apply self-joins in your queries. 
Always refer to the Oracle documentation for the specific version you are using for detailed information on self-joins and hierarchical queries.
