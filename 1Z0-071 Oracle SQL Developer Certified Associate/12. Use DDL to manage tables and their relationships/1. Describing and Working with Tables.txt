In the context of relational databases, Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to manage tables and their relationships. 
DDL statements are responsible for defining, altering, and deleting database structures. 
Here are some common DDL statements related to managing tables and their relationships:

Create a Table:
Use the CREATE TABLE statement to define a new table. 
Include the column names along with their data types and any constraints.
    CREATE TABLE employees (
        employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(50),
        last_name VARCHAR(50),
        hire_date DATE,
        department_id INT,
        CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id));

Alter Table Structure:
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to modify an existing table. You can add, modify, or drop columns.
    ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
    ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY last_name VARCHAR(100);
    ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN hire_date;

Create Index:
Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. 
Use the CREATE INDEX statement to create an index on one or more columns.
    CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees(last_name);

Create Unique Constraint:
A unique constraint ensures that values in a column or a group of columns are unique across the table.
    ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT uc_employee_id UNIQUE (employee_id);

Create Check Constraint:
A check constraint enforces a condition on the values in a column.
    ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary > 0);

Drop Table:
Use the DROP TABLE statement to remove a table and its data from the database.
Be cautious when using DROP TABLE as it permanently deletes the table and its data.
    DROP TABLE employees;

These are some basic examples of how DDL statements can be used to manage tables and their relationships in a relational database. 
Make sure to adapt these examples to your specific database schema and requirements.
