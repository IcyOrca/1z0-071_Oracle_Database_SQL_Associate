    "\n",
    "<strong>LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN):</strong> Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. If there’s no match, the result includes NULL for columns from the right table.\n",

    "    SELECT column_names\n",
    "      FROM table1\n",
    "      LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;\n",

    "    SELECT column_names\n",

    "      RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>FULL OUTER JOIN:</strong> Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOINs to return all records when there is a match in one of the tables. Unmatched rows from both tables will show NULL in place of columns from the other table.\n",
