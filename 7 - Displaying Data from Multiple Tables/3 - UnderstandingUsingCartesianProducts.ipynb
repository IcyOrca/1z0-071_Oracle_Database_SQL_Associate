    "\n",
    "    Use Join Conditions: Always specify a JOIN condition when joining tables unless a Cartesian Product is intentional.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Check SQL Statements: Especially in complex queries, double-check that each table join is followed by the appropriate condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Beware of Large Datasets: Cartesian Products grow exponentially based on the number of rows. With large tables, they can consume significant resources and slow down queries.\n",
