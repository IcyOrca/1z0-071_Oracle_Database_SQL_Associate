    "<strong>A Non-Equijoin is a type of join that uses conditions other than equality to relate rows from two tables. <br>These joins allow more flexible comparisons, such as greater than, less than, or other non-equal operators, to match rows based on ranges or other complex conditions.</strong>"

    "<h3>What is a Non-Equijoin?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>In a Non-Equijoin, columns from two tables are related through operators like <, >, <=, >=, !=, or BETWEEN.\n",
    "<br>This is particularly useful when matching data within a range, such as matching employees to salary grades or sales to commission rates.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT e.employee_id, e.salary, g.grade_level\n",
    "      FROM employees e, salary_grades g\n",
    "     WHERE e.salary BETWEEN g.min_salary AND g.max_salary;\n",
    "\n",
    "This matches each employee's salary to the appropriate grade level by checking if the salary falls within the range defined by min_salary and max_salary in the salary_grades table."
