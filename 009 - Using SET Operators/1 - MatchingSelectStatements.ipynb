    "<strong>Same Number of Columns: </strong>Each SELECT query in the set operation must return the same number of columns.\n",
    "<br><strong>Data Types Must Be Compatible: </strong>The corresponding columns in each SELECT statement must have compatible data types, meaning they must either be the same or easily convertible.\n",
    "<br><strong>Column Names in the Final Output: </strong>The column names in the result set will be taken from the first SELECT statement, regardless of what they are named in subsequent statements.\n",

    "    SELECT first_name, last_name FROM contractors;\n",
