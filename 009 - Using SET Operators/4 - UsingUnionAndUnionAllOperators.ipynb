    "<strong>Practical Use Cases:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    UNION: Ideal when you want a distinct set of results, such as when retrieving unique records from multiple tables that may have overlapping data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    UNION ALL: Useful when you need all rows from each table and duplicates are acceptable. For example, when combining logs from two systems, where repeated entries are expected and important for auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use UNION cautiously: Removing duplicates can slow down query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Use UNION only when you genuinely need unique results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prefer UNION ALL when duplicates are irrelevant: When duplicates don’t affect your results, use UNION ALL to boost performance."
