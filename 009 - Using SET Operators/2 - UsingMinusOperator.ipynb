    "<br>It essentially subtracts the results of the second query from the first, providing a way to identify rows that exist in one dataset but not the other.</strong>"

    "<h3>Key Features of the MINUS Operator</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Difference in Result Sets: </strong>The MINUS operator returns rows that are unique to the first query, excluding those that appear in the second.\n",
    "<br><strong>Duplicate Elimination: </strong>It automatically removes duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "<br><strong>Ordering: </strong>The results of the MINUS operation are not automatically ordered. If required, you need to use an ORDER BY clause explicitly after the MINUS operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "    SELECT column_list FROM table1\n",
    "    MINUS\n",
    "    SELECT column_list FROM table2;\n",
    "\n",
    "The column_list must have the same number of columns in both queries, and the data types of corresponding columns should be compatible."
