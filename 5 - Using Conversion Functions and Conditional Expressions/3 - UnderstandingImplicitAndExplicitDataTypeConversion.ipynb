    "\n",
    "<strong>Implicit data type conversion, also known as automatic conversion, occurs when the database engine automatically converts one data type to another without the need for user intervention.\n",
    "<br>This typically happens when the context of a query requires different data types to be compatible, such as in expressions or comparisons.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Consider a situation where a numeric value is compared to a string. The database automatically converts the string to a number for the comparison.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = '50000';\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if the salary column is a numeric type and the comparison is made against a string, the database will convert the string '50000' to a number."

    "<h3>Explicit Data Type Conversion</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Explicit data type conversion requires the user to specify the conversion using a conversion function such as TO_CHAR, TO_NUMBER, or TO_DATE.\n",
    "<br>This type of conversion is intentional and provides greater control over how data is transformed, ensuring that the output is formatted as desired.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> To convert a string representation of a number into a numeric type, you would use the TO_NUMBER function:\n",
