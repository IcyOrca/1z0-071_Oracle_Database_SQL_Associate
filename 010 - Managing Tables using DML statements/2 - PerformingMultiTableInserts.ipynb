    "<h3>Syntax for Multi-Table Inserts</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Multi-table inserts can be done in several ways depending on the database system being used. Here are common methods:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Using INSERT ... SELECT for Related Tables</strong>\n",
    "This method allows you to insert records into one table based on the results of a SELECT statement from another table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id)\n",
    "    SELECT 'John', 'Doe', department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales';\n",
    "    \n",
    "<strong>Using INSERT ALL Statement</strong>\n",
    "In Oracle, you can use the INSERT ALL statement to insert data into multiple tables at once.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    INSERT ALL\n",
    "      INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id) VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 10)\n",
    "      INTO contractors (first_name, last_name, contract_id) VALUES ('Bob', 'Jones', 20)\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM dual;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Using INSERT INTO ... VALUES for Multiple Rows</strong>\n",
    "You can also insert multiple rows into a single table at once. This method is typically used when inserting into one table only.\n",
    "\n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id) \n",
    "    VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 10), \n",
    "           ('Bob', 'Jones', 20);"

    "<strong>Practical Use Cases:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Multi-table inserts can streamline data entry processes, especially when dealing with related datasets. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example, when onboarding new employees, you may want to insert records into both the employees table and a salary table in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Maintain Referential Integrity: Ensure that inserts into related tables respect foreign key constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    se Transactions: Always wrap multi-table inserts in a transaction to maintain data integrity in case of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test and Validate: Thoroughly test multi-table insert operations to ensure they perform as expected without data loss."
