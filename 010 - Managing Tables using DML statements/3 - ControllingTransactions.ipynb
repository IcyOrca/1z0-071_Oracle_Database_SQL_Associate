    "\n",
    "<strong>Transaction States:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Active: The transaction is in progress.\n",
    "    Partially Committed: The transaction has executed all its operations but has not yet been committed.\n",
    "    Failed: The transaction has encountered an error and cannot be completed.\n",
    "    Committed: The transaction has successfully completed and all changes are saved to the database.\n",
    "    Aborted: The transaction has been rolled back and changes are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>ACID Properties: </strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Atomicity: Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.\n",
    "    Consistency: Guarantees that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another.\n",
    "    Isolation: Ensures that transactions operate independently of one another.\n",
    "    Durability: Guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain in the system even in the event of a failure."

    "<strong>Practical Use Cases:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Controlling transactions is crucial in scenarios where multiple related operations need to succeed or fail together. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For instance, when transferring funds between accounts, both the debit and credit operations must succeed; otherwise, the transaction should be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use Transactions for Related Operations: Always use transactions for operations that are logically related and must succeed or fail together.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Keep Transactions Short: Limit the duration of transactions to reduce locking and potential contention in the database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling to manage transaction failures and rollbacks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test Thoroughly: Always test transaction control logic to ensure that it behaves as expected under various scenarios."
