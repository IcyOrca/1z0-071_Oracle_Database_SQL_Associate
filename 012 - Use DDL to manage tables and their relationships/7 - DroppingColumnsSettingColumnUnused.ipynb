    "<strong>Best Practices for Dropping and Setting Columns as UNUSED</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unused Columns for Large Tables: For very large tables, it's often more efficient to mark columns as UNUSED rather than drop them immediately, since this operation is faster and does not require table locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reclaim Space When Necessary: Regularly drop UNUSED columns to reclaim storage space, especially if many columns have been marked UNUSED over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Review Impact: Ensure that dropping or marking a column UNUSED does not impact dependent objects like views, indexes, or application logic. Oracle will raise errors if any dependencies exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Monitor Storage Usage: Dropping columns can help optimize table space, so keep an eye on storage use after dropping columns, especially in databases with heavy usage."
