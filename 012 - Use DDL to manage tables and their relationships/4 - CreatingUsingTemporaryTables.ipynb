    "    Improved Performance: Temporary tables store data in temporary segments in memory, reducing the load on disk-based storage. This improves the performance of intermediate result handling.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Automatic Cleanup: The data in temporary tables is automatically cleaned up at the end of the transaction or session, eliminating the need for manual deletion."
